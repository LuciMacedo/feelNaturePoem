            Long to see the beautiful flowers <br>
            In the lovely garden of sunflowers <br>
            Love to breath the fresh air <br>
            When no one could ever fear. <br>

            The sweet birds singing on the trees <br>
            Nowhere to hear nowadays <br>
            The children laughing at the loudest <br>
            No one could hear them the simplest. <br>

            The nature’s touch slowly separates <br>
            The humanity is tattered indebts <br>
            No one is brave to explore out dates <br>
            What they have is to aim the safest. <br>

            People and nature have their space <br>
            On this era of pandemic disease <br>
            Everyone is afraid to expose to places <br>
            They want to stay at home as based. <br>

            Far from the nature’s touch simplify the mass <br>
            Address the issue as the horrible grass <br>
            Non sense to express the best trust <br>
            When no one could ever grasp. <br>
            Afterall we must be at the middle class <br>
            Sensing the seasons of no clash <br>
            Counting the messages we must <br>
            To feel the nature’s touch at last. <br>
